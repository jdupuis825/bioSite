    <h1><u>A Little Bit About William</u></h1>

        William (Bill) Trowbridge is a hardworking forty-year-old family man who loves the great outdoors. He is a jack of all trades having worked as an electrician, stone mason, and artificial turf installer previously. Though now he has spent the last eight years fabricating and installing granite, marble, and solid surface countertops. He prides himself in working hard so that he can help provide the best life for his family; a safe home, food on the table, and a happy family (including his best friend Keyser, his one-hundred-pound fur baby) is the ultimate driving force.

        Besides his family, if he could pick three things that he loves and looks forward to doing they would be traveling, hunting, and fishing. Bill loves to travel with his partner Jocelyn near and far; some of his favorite places are Chicago and Alabama for music festivals, and Jamacia. Though one of his most favorite trips was to the Riviera Maya in Mexico with the whole family where they went snorkeling, ziplining, swimming in a cenote, and climbed the tallest pyramid in Cob√†: lxmoja. Throughout different seasons you will often find Bill in the woods scoping out the land for animal tracks and traces or in the garage adjusting his arrowheads. You can also find him up north in the Hudson River fly fishing for King Salmon or Coho.

        In the coming years the kids will be adults and he and his partner Jocelyn hope to buy an RV and travel the country. They would like to experience different climates and regions for a few years before they decide on a new place to put down some roots. They are gypsies at heart and look forward to adventures and new experiences.
