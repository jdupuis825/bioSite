        William (Bill) Trowbridge is a hardworking forty-year-old family man who loves the great outdoors. He is a jack of all trades having previously worked as an electrician, stone mason, and artificial turf installer. For the last eight years he's been fabricating and installing granite, marble, and solid surface countertops. He prides himself in working hard so that he can help provide the best life for his family, it's his ultimate driving force. A safe home, food on the table, and everyone happy is the best reward. This also includes the family dog, a one-hundred-pound fur baby and most importantly - his <u>best friend</u>.

        Besides his family, if he could pick three things that he loves and looks forward the most to they would be <em>traveling, hunting, and fishing</em>. Bill loves to travel near and far with his partner Jocelyn; some of his favorite places are Chicago and Alabama for music festivals, and of course Jamacia. Though one of his most favorite trips was to the Riviera Maya in Mexico with the whole family where they went snorkeling, ziplining, swimming in a cenote, and climbed the tallest pyramid in Cob√†: lxmoja. Throughout different seasons you will often find Bill in the woods foraging for mushrooms, scoping out the land for animal tracks or in the garage sharpening his arrowheads. You can also find him up north in the Hudson River fly fishing for King Salmon or Coho.

        In the coming years the kids will be adults which is when him and Jocelyn hope to buy an RV and travel the country. They would like to experience different climates and regions for a few years before they decide on a new place to put down some roots. They are gypsies at heart and are always looking forward to new adventures and experiences.
