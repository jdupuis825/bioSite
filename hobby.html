        <p>
        For this bioSite I choose my partner of almost ten years William Trowbridge. We have a blended family of two boys (fourteen and eighteen) and a one-hundred-pound fur baby. Being that we have been together for so long and live together Bill was a great choice to pick since I know him well, Iâ€™m able to interview him at any point, he can give me his feedback on layout, font choice, color scheme, etc. The start of this bioSite has also given me the chance to learn about him even more. I had a decent amount of questions for his interview, some normal, some I felt already knew, and some random out of the box questions; I was even surprised by some of the answers.

        Bill is a lover of the outdoors and anything that has to do with hunting, fishing, and traveling. If he could do anything for a day it would be to travel, if he won the lottery he would travel, if money was of no issue - can you guess what he would do? He would travel. His favorite hobbies may be hunting, fishing, and traveling, but what he loves the most is his family. It is his driving force to work hard, it is his greatest accomplishment, and it is the one thing he would never want to live without. William enjoys the little things that make the big things all the more worthwhile.
